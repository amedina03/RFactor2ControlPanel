# rFactor2 Control Console
This application allows for remote management of up to 8 stations running the game **rFactor2** from a central administrator's console. It consists of two main components:

### 1. **rFactor2Api**
This component needs to be installed on each computer running **rFactor2**. Follow the steps below to set it up:

- Download and run the API on each game station. Ensure you run it as an administrator.
- If you'd prefer to create a standalone executable file, you can use **pyinstaller** with the following command:
  ```bash
  pyinstaller --onefile rfactor2api.py
  ```
This will generate an executable for easier deployment.

### 2. **Server Admin**
This is the control console that runs on the main administrator's computer. It allows you to remotely manage the stations. To create the executable:

- Compile the program and click **Publish**. This will generate an executable at:
bash
```bash
  Server Admin/bin/Release/neo8.0-windows
```
- Again, ensure the executable is run as an administrator.

- **Preserve the format**: When modifying files for customization make sure to use the same format as it has by default, if after a modification the application stops working properly erase the files and start it again, this will create another set of example files.
- **For configuration changes** (e.g., changing player names or difficulty settings):
  - Close the game using the **top-right close button** in the console.
  - Update the settings, save them, and reopen the game.
